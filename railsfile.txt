Create new Project:
rails new proj_name –d mysql
Bundles and Gems:
gem install bundler
cd project_folder
bundle install 
GIT:
git init
git remote add origin (link to repo)
git add.
git remote rm origin (remove)
git add -A
git commit –m “start”
git push
Running a SQL server:
mysql-ctl start
mysql-ctl stop
creating root user
SET PASSWORD FOR 'bob'@'%.example.org' = PASSWORD('auth_string');
or
mysql –u root -p (login)


then
https://docs.c9.io/docs/setting-up-mysql
go to config->database.yml and write username and password.

Accessing a Project:
run the server by rails s –b $IP –p $PORT
access it via URL
####################################

Controller,Model,View:
rails generate controller contr-name action-name (action name is optional and you can also give multiple actions).

Routes:
get “demo/index”  means
match “demo/index”,
	:to => “demo#index”,
	:via => :get
	Default route

General route:
match ‘controller(/:action(/:id)), :via => get

###########################
Embedding Ruby in erb:
<% code %> only executes the code
<%= code %> displays the result of code (ruby code)
URLs:
<a href=”/demo/hello”>Hello page </a>
or
<%= link_to(‘text’,{:controller=>”demo”,:action=>”hello”}) %>

#########################

Database:
1 table = 1 model
Model name singular, table name plural
4 mySQL commands
SHOW DATABASES;
CREATE DATABASE db_name; (written in yml file)
USE db_name;
DROP DATABASE db_name;
SHOW TABLES;
SHOW FIELDS FROM table_name;
Database Migration:
rails generate migration mgr_name (that could be anything)
Rake db:create
Rake db:migrate (every time you make some change, you need to run this.)
Creating new User for mySQL and giving permissions to access:
CREATE USER 'custom'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
#GRANT ALL PRIVILIGES ON db_name.* TO 'custom'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL ON db_name.* TO 'custom'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';

SHOW GRANTS FOR ‘username’@’localhost’;
YML:
YML means this file is in YAML format 
YAML ain’t markup language;


1.	Rails generate model volunteers name:string etc (this will create a model and a migration)
2.	Rake db:migrate (table added to database)
3.	Rake db:rollback (table deleted from database)
4.	Manually create controller and views
5.	For one set of views, one controller
6.	Set routes. First function will be called in controller and then page code will run when we’ll type URL
7.	User.create(username: "databurj",password: "windows787!")

############################################

To Do List:

Sohail:
<%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
